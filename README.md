# Idle Hands
A jQuery plugin for managing user inactivity timeoutes across browsers windows.

## Requirements
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Idle Hands uses the jQuery library to more easily interact with the DOM and make ajax calls.
* [Basil.js](https://wisembly.github.io/basil.js/) - Idle Hands uses Basil.js as a `localStorage` wrapper to more easily persist data across browser windows and tabs.
