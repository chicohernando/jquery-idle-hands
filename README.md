# Idle Hands
A jQuery plugin for managing user inactivity timeoutes across browsers windows.

## Requirements
* [Lockr](https://github.com/tsironis/lockr) - Idle Hands uses the Lockr `localStorage` wrapper to more easily persist data across browser windows and tabs.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Idle Hands uses the jQuery library to more easily interact with the DOM and make ajax calls.
